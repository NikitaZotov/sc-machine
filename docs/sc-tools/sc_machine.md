Sc-machine is a sc-memory with opportunity to add modules consistent with the general sc-machine interface. All such 
modules are named extensions, must be shared libraries (with file extension `.so` or `.dylib`) and stored in common directory 
(by default it is `./bin/extensions`). By default, sc-machine contains sc-server that allows to communicate with 
sc-memory through network. You can find `sc-machine` in a `bin` directory.

There are options of sc-machine:
